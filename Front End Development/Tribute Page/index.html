    <li><b>1970:</b> - Hired for the summer following his senior year of high school to write a numerical analysis program in Fortran. Enrolled at Harvard University the following Autumn, and was known for his strong performance in the infamous freshman Math 55 course.</li>

    <li><b>1983:</b> - Announces the project to develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software.</li>
    <li><b>1984:</b> - Resigns from his position at MIT in order to focus on the GNU project full time.</li>
    <li><b>1985:</b> - Starts the Free Software Foundation, a nonprofit with a worldwide mission to promote computer user freedom. GNU Emacs is widely distributed for the first time.</li>
